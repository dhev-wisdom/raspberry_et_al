# Detailed Code Explanation
"""
# 1. line 1 declares function solve. solve tkaes two arguments, a, an array, and d, an integer. a = array, d = decimal
# 2. line 2, l is initialzed to 0 and r is initialized to the length of list a
# l and r are used to create a search range within list a 
# l startes at 0 which is the starting point of the list. r is the index that marks the end of the list, but it's one over.
# That is last index + 1. l = left, r = right
# 3. A while loop in started on line 3 and runs provided the leftmost index is lower than then right most index
# this ensures that there is a valid search range to consider. If l is no longer less than r, then, there is nothing to search for
# 4. On line 4, variable m is initialized and defined and it's used to calculate the middle index of the search range
# That is left most + right most divided by 2. The `//` is used to ensure that m is an integer.
# 5 / 2 returns 2.5 while 5 // 2 returns 2
# m = middle
# 5. Line 5 checks if the element at index 'm' of the array is equal to d + m (decimal + middle)
# You are essentially checking if element at index m of array is the number you are searching for + the middle index number
# The reason for this step will be clearer soon
# 6. In line 6, if element at index m of array is equal to d + m, it means that the current element is positioned as expected in a sorted sequence
# That means that the elemnts to the left of the middle are also correctly positioned. So we need to narrow our search to the right part of m
# That's why l, left is shifted to one index after the middle; l = m + 1
# 7. Line 7: If otherwise, a[m] is not equal to d + m, it means the current elements is not in the correct position
# And elements before it (to the left) are also likely out of place
# So, we should continue the dearch of the left side of m
# r, right, is now brought down to m, the middle, from its top positon at the end of the list
# The first  iteration of the loop ends and the list to be search is halved
# The loop continues, so does the halving, till l is equal to r
# The function returns l + d, which is also same as r + d.
# This is essentially the count of correctly positioned elements + d which accounts for any offset intoduced by the d value

# The function can re-written thus for better readability
